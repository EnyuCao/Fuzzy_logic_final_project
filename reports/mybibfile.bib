% Used a combination of fuzzy logic and an artificial neural network to create an adaptive neural fuzzy logic pathfinding algorithm that improved on several other pure fuzzy logic algorithms. The adaptive fuzzy logic pathfinding algorithm made slower calculations, but had overall faster routes and could deal with tighter courses.

% Used a two layer fuzzy logic system. The first layer was based on the A* algorithm to find the shortest path. The second layer fine tunes the movement to make sure the robot finds a “smooth” path towards the end.

% Created an adaptive 2 layer fuzzy logic system to have two robots move towards a goal while avoiding collisions with each other. It uses a genetic algorithm to generate the rules for the fuzzy logic system. The robots achieve their goals in most but not all cases, the edge cases could be fixed at the cost of more learning for the genetic algorithm.
