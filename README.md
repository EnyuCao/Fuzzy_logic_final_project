# Fuzzy logic final project 2017/2018
Jelle van Dijk, Gawan Dekker, Victor Gladys

## How to run
Running simulation.py with python 3 will start the simulation.

In the top of the file a few global vars can be set to alter the simulation. 
- turning g_testing on will start the simulation in testing mode which will print data but does not show the simulation on the screen.
- g_playerSpeed sets the speed of the player
- g_obstSpeed sets the speed of the obstacles
- when not testing g_fisFile points to the .fis file which will be used to create the FLS
